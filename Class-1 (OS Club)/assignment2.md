### Assignment: Create an Analogue Clock Layout

#### Objective:
Design a functional and visually appealing analogue clock using only HTML and CSS. This assignment aims to help you understand positioning, transformations, and CSS animations.

#### Problem Statement:
You are required to create an analogue clock that displays the current time using HTML and CSS. The clock should have hour, minute, and second hands, and should be styled to resemble a traditional analogue clock.

#### Requirements:
1. **Clock Face**:
   - Create a circular clock face.
   - The clock face should have markings or numbers for the hours (1 to 12).
   
2. **Clock Hands**:
   - Implement three clock hands: hour, minute, and second hands.
   - Each hand should be positioned and styled appropriately to indicate time.
   - The hands should rotate smoothly to represent the passing time.

3. **Styling**:
   - Use CSS to style the clock face and hands.
   - Apply transformations (rotation) to the hands to simulate the time.
   - You are allowed to use only HTML and CSS (no JavaScript).
   - The clock should be responsive and maintain its layout across different screen sizes.

4. **Advanced Features (Optional)**:
   - Style the clock face with additional elements like borders, shadows, or gradients.
   - Add numbers to the clock face for each hour (1 to 12).
   - Implement a different design theme (e.g., modern, vintage).

#### Hints:
- Use `border-radius` to create a circular clock face.
- Use `position: absolute;` for the hands, anchored to the center of the clock face.
- Use `transform-origin` to define the pivot point for rotating the clock hands.
- Use `transform: rotate(deg)` to rotate the hands.
- You may find it helpful to use CSS animations for smoother transitions of the hands, but this is optional.

#### Example:
Imagine a simple white circular clock face with black markings for the hours and three hands (black for hours and minutes, red for seconds) that correctly represent the current time.
