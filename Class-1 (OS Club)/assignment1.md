### Assignment: Create a Pinterest-like Layout with HTML and CSS

#### Objective:
Create a responsive Pinterest-like layout using only HTML and CSS. The layout should automatically adjust based on the screen size, displaying content in a masonry grid style without using any JavaScript frameworks or libraries.

#### Problem Statement:
You are required to design a webpage that mimics the Pinterest layout, where content is arranged in a grid format with varying heights for the content boxes. The layout should be responsive, meaning it adjusts seamlessly across different screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.

#### Requirements:
1. **Layout**:
   - Create a grid layout that displays items in a Pinterest-like fashion. The items should be arranged in columns with varying heights.
   - Use CSS Grid or Flexbox to create the grid. Avoid using JavaScript for layout purposes.

2. **Responsiveness**:
   - The grid should display 1 column on small screens (e.g., mobile), 2-3 columns on medium screens (e.g., tablets), and 4-5 columns on large screens (e.g., desktops).
   - Ensure that the layout is fluid and adapts to different screen sizes without breaking.

3. **Content Boxes**:
   - Each content box should have an image, title, and a short description. 
   - The height of the content boxes can vary based on the content inside them.

4. **Styling**:
   - Use CSS to style the content boxes, including a hover effect that enlarges the box slightly and adds a shadow for a 3D effect.
   - Use a consistent color scheme and typography throughout the layout.
   - Include some padding and margin to create a visually appealing spacing between the content boxes.

5. **Additional Features**:
   - Implement a simple header and footer for the webpage.
   - The header should include a title or logo and a simple navigation bar.
   - The footer can include basic information like links to social media or contact details.

#### Hints:
- **CSS Grid**: Use `grid-template-columns` to define how many columns should be displayed at different screen sizes.
- **Flexbox**: If using Flexbox, you can make use of `flex-wrap` and `align-items` properties to achieve a masonry effect.
- **Media Queries**: Use media queries to make the layout responsive across different screen sizes.

#### Submission:
- Submit the HTML and CSS files, along with a screenshot of the layout in mobile, tablet, and desktop views.
- Ensure the code is well-commented and organized.
- Deploy the final project on GitHub Pages and share the link.

#### Evaluation Criteria:
- **Layout**: Proper implementation of the Pinterest-like grid layout.
- **Responsiveness**: How well the layout adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Design**: Visual appeal, including colors, typography, and spacing.
- **Code Quality**: Clean, readable, and well-commented code.
